# vue-pather
A Script to correct vue apps paths in production for hosting on Apache servers.

## Requires
- Node.js
## How to use script
For now this is just a script you will download and use in the dist folder.
To run the script hit:
- `node index.js`
- Enter the name of the file (`index.html`)
Note: This script should be in the same directory with your production code `index.html` for it to work proparly.

## Why vue-pather?
It's tedious to always have to rename the path in your `index.html` so this automates the process for you.
